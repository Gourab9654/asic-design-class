## GCC Compilation Of a simple C Program
### Step 1
* In the Linux Environment, create a new C Program file using any editor. Here the leafpad editor is used.
  1. **Code Snippet:**
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int i, n=5, sum=0;
        for(i=1; i<=n; i++){
          sum = sum + i;
        }
        printf("The sum from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
* Save the program and compile your code in the terminal window using GCC compiler.

## RISC-V Compilation Of a simple C Program
### Step 1
1. **Code Snippet:**
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        int i, n=5, sum=0;
        for(i=1; i<=n; i++){
          sum = sum + i;
        }
        printf("The sum from 1 to %d is %d\n", n, sum);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
* Compile the C code on RISC-V compiler

* Now create the object file (.o) that is the output of the compiler as shown in the procedure shown below.
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 145313](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/120bef44-0acf-4fcd-88b9-02b48cc71609)

### Step 2
* Run the executable program and see the output in the terminal window.
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 145751](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34bd3441-d2da-49b2-914b-6672252fda8e)

* For the "main" section, we can calculate the number of instructions either by counting each individual instruction or we can subtract the address of the first instruction in the next section with the first instruction of the main section and divide the difference with 4 since it is a byte addressable memory, so 4 memory block form one instruction
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 150053](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d28e2d-07e8-4aec-9f56-e94585f9cc2d)

* E.g.: No. of instruction in main block = (0x101C0 - 0x10184)/4 = 0x3C/4 = 0xF = 15 instructions
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 150210](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec2004a-440f-4d5b-af8f-8b9d12efb600)
### Step 3
* Compile the code again with the compiler flag set as **-Ofast** and observe the generated assembly code
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 150613](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c808bb07-659a-44c3-b75f-1e51c5e27ea8)

* Assembly code generated with **-Ofast** compiler flag
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 150839](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33aa5b33-b0cf-4198-ac25-97d080ea8a75)
![Screenshot 2024-07-17 150920](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/726b7516-90fa-45fb-ba2e-39ef6f1735f1)
### Observation
Here we can observe that the number of instructions are reduced to 12 as compared to 15 in the previous case
* -O1 is moderate in it's code optimization while -Ofast is highly aggressive to achieve highest possible performance
* -O1 maintains strict adherence to standards while -Ofast may violate some standards to achieve better performance

##  RISC-V COMPILER OUTPUT and DEBUGGING

Find the output of the C program on the RISC V Compiler using the Spike command and debug the code

### Check the Output and compare with previous output.
In our previous lab, we compiled our C code using both gcc and a RISC-V compiler. In assignment 3 we are going to have find the result of n numbers on the RISCV compiler using the SPIKE command.

### Code for compiling the objdump file
```bash
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
### The compiled code using SPIKE command along with object dump file
![Similar result for GCC and RISCV compiler when run the program](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a290394-20ed-4082-a01b-4ce624035b23)
* Here we can see that we get the same output in both the process.

![objectdump that is to be debugged](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f80656e-beaa-4453-b348-0072af306c4a)

### Debug using SPIKE debugger

Code for debugging the assembly code 
```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```
We will allow the Spike debugger to run until the main function, specifically until the 100b0 instruction. After that, we will manually continue debugging and inspect the a0 register before and after the execution. We observe that the instruction lui a0, 0x21 updates the a0 register from 0x0000000000000001 to 0x0000000000021000
```bash
until pc 0 100bo
```
Next, we will manually debug the next instruction i.e., addi sp, sp, -16. This instruction decrements the stack pointer (sp) by 16. Before executing this instruction, the sp register held the value 0x0000003ffffffb50, which is then updated to 0x0000003ffffffb40.
```bash
reg 0 sp
```
In the assembly code we can see that the value of the stack pointer is being reduced by 10 in hexadecimal we is equivalent to being reduced by 16 in decimal notation.

### The same thing happens for -O1 as well

```bash
until pc 0 10184
```

## ASSIGNMENT 4
### 1.Identifying Instruction Types

* As the activity suggests, intruction types are being indentified for the instructions provided. The 32bit code is identified to do so. Each instruction type has it's own instruction format.

**What are instruction formats in RISCV?** 

Instruction formats can be considered as a 'contract' betwwen the assembly language and the hardware where, if the assembly language 'demands' to execute the instruction, the hardware knows exactly what to do with it. Therefore, there exists certain instructions and their respective format for the hardware to understand. They are made up of series of 0s and 1s depending upon their format, which includes the type of operation, location of data, etc.

There exists 6 types of instruction formats in RISCV.

* R type

    + 'R' here stands for register. 
    + This type inculcates all arithmetic and logical operations.
    +  They are used for operations that involve 3 registers.
    +  The format of R-type instructions is consistent and includes fields for specifying two source registers, one destination register, a function code to specify the operation, and an opcode.
    +  Examples: ADD, SUB, OR, XOR, etc.
    +  The instruction format is as follows: 
  
  ![rtype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/518e5b3b-046d-452b-90a4-4dc22a78accf)
    + funct7 (7 bits): Function code for additional instruction differentiation.
    + rs2 (5 bits): Second source register.
    + rs1 (5 bits): First source register.
    + funct3 (3 bits): Function code for primary instruction differentiation.
    + rd (5 bits): Destination register.
    + opcode (7 bits): Basic operation code for R-type instructions (0110011 for integer operations).
* I type

    + I-type instructions in the RISC-V architecture are used for operations that involve an immediate value along with one or two registers.
    +  These instructions typically perform operations such as arithmetic with immediate values, load operations, and certain branch instructions.
    +  The format of I-type instructions includes fields for a source register, destination register, an immediate value, a function code, and an opcode.
    +  The instruction format is as follows:
  
  ![itype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/044814e2-9f7b-453a-8541-d2650c4e15ab)
    + immediate (12 bits): Immediate value used for operations.
    + rs1 (5 bits): Source register.
    + funct3 (3 bits): Function code for instruction differentiation.
    + rd (5 bits): Destination register.
    + opcode (7 bits): Basic operation code for I-type instructions.
  
* S Type 
  
    + S-type instructions in the RISC-V architecture are used for store operations, where data is stored from a register into memory.
   + The format of S-type instructions includes fields for two source registers, an immediate value that determines the memory offset, a function code, and an opcode.
   +  The format is as follows: 

  ![stype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2c61ec-2ab2-46f3-98a7-a351d43387a2)
    + imm[11:5] (7 bits): Upper 7 bits of the immediate value.
    + rs2 (5 bits): Second source register (contains the data to be stored).
    + rs1 (5 bits): First source register (base address register).
    + funct3 (3 bits): Function code for instruction differentiation.
    + imm[4:0] (5 bits): Lower 5 bits of the immediate value.
    + opcode (7 bits): Basic operation code for S-type instructions.

* B Type

    + B-type instructions in the RISC-V architecture are used for conditional branch operations.
    +  These instructions are designed to alter the flow of execution based on comparisons between two registers. 
    +  The format of B-type instructions includes fields for two source registers, an immediate value that determines the branch offset, a function code, and an opcode.
    +  Following is the instruction format:
    
     ![btype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8c4c251-9d0e-43bb-bc2d-5d62f6546a94)
    + imm[12] (1 bit): The 12th bit of the immediate value.
    + imm[10:5] (6 bits): The 10th to 5th bits of the immediate value.
    + rs2 (5 bits): Second source register.
    + rs1 (5 bits): First source register.
    + funct3 (3 bits): Function code for instruction differentiation.
    + imm[4:1] (4 bits): The 4th to 1st bits of the immediate value.
    + imm[11] (1 bit): The 11th bit of the immediate value.
    + opcode (7 bits): Basic operation code for B-type instructions

* U Type

    + U-type instructions in the RISC-V architecture are used for operations involving large immediate values, typically for loading upper immediate values or computing addresses.
    +  The format of U-type instructions includes fields for a destination register, a large immediate value, and an opcode.
    +  The instruction format is as follows:
  
     ![utype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27da568d-cc13-49f7-b291-fe9bec1e0a0f)

    + immediate[31:12] (20 bits): The upper 20 bits of the immediate value.
    + rd (5 bits): Destination register.
    + opcode (7 bits): Operation code for U-type instructions.
    + The immediate value is stored in the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit word, with the lower 12 bits set to zero when used in calculations.

* J type
    + J-type instructions in the RISC-V architecture are used for jump operations, allowing for altering the program control flow by jumping to a specified address.
    + These instructions are typically used for unconditional jumps, like calling functions or implementing loops.
    + Following is the instruction format: 
     
    ![jtype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2b575bf-f23f-4064-8cce-015d24a712c4)
    + imm[20] (1 bit): The 20th bit of the immediate value.
    + imm[10:1] (10 bits): The 10th to 1st bits of the immediate value.
    + imm[11] (1 bit): The 11th bit of the immediate value.
    + imm[19:12] (8 bits): The 19th to 12th bits of the immediate value.
    + rd (5 bits): Destination register where the return address is stored.
    + opcode (7 bits): Operation code for J-type instructions.

**Introduction to TL-Verilog and Makerchip:**
Makerchip supports the Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) standard, which represents a significant advancement by removing the need for the legacy features of traditional Verilog and introducing a more streamlined syntax. TL-Verilog enhances design efficiency by adding powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions, making it easier to develop complex digital circuits.

## Sequential Circuits in TL-Verilog
### Sequential Calculator

Calculators tend to remember the previous result and use it for the next operation. The sequential calculator does this and feeds back the output to the next input. The code for the same is as follows:-

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
	
\TLV
   //$count[31:0] = 32'b0;
   
   // Sequential Clock
   
   |calc
      @1
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
         $reset = *reset;
         $val1[31:0] = >>1$result[31:0];
         $val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
         $result[31:0] = $reset ? 32'b0 : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b00)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] + $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b01)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] - $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b10)
                         ? ($val1[31:0] * $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b11)
                         ? ($val2[31:0] != 0 ? ($val1[31:0] / $val2[31:0]) : 32'bx) :  32'b0;
         //$count[31:0] = $reset  ? 0 : (>>1$count + 1);
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 40;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
	endmodule;

```

This gives us the following waveforms and block diagram:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55434301-1098-4344-ae9f-2246f605a276)

### Pipelined Logic:-

Pipelining is used to maximise resource utilisation and thus reduce the delays in performing all the operations in a given task. In order to do so me make sure that every block in our system is working almost in every cycle such that it does not affect the operation of any other block which may be dependent or independent of its result. We have used a pythagorean calculator in our case. The code for the same is as follows.

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
	`include "sqrt32.v"
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
\TLV
   |calc
      @1
         $reset = *reset;
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
      ?$valid
         @1
            $aa_sq[31:0] = $aa[3:0] * $aa[3:0];
            $bb_sq[31:0] = $bb[3:0] * $bb[3:0];
         @2
            $cc_sq[31:0] = $aa_sq + $bb_sq;
         @3
            $cc[31:0] = sqrt($cc_sq);
         //@4
         //$tot_dist[63:0] = $reset ? 0 : $valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $cc) : >>1$tot_dist;
            
         //@4
         //$adder[31:0] = $cc + >>1$tot_dist;
         //@5
         //$tot_dist[31:0] = $valid ? ( >>1$tot_dist + $adder ) : >>1$tot_dist
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 16'd30;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
   endmodule
```

The output for the following code is as follows:-

![Pipelined_logic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/291685cf-eb23-46ea-a894-68b6faf91deb)

### Cycle Calculator

In the sequential calculator we have taken the output of the previous result and fed it back to the next input but in this case we are using 3 stages of pipeline instead of 2 and therefore the calculator input will receive input which is 2 cycles older.

```bash

\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)
\TLV
   //$count[31:0] = 32'b0;
   |calc
      @1
         $clk_omkar = *clk;
         $reset = *reset;
         $val1[31:0] = >>2$result[31:0];
         $val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
         
      @2
         $valid = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$valid + 1);
         $out[31:0] = ($reset | !($valid)) ? 32'b0 : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b00) ? ($val1[31:0] + $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b01) ? ($val1[31:0] - $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b10) ? ($val1[31:0] * $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b11) ? ($val2[31:0] != 0 ? ($val1[31:0] / $val2[31:0]) : 32'bx) :  32'b0;
         
   
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 40;
   *failed = 1'b0;
\SV
   endmodule

```

The output for the cycle calculator is as follows:-

![Cycle_calculator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264f1c05-9198-4440-b2ec-fbf17d0d14ca)

### Validity

When we generate a waveform as in all the previous cases we are receiving a result for all the clock cycles. Here there are no compilation errors but it is quite possible that logical errors can be present in these cases. These errors will be ignored during compile time and it will be difficult to debug them by simply looking at the waveforms. Also there might be certain cases where a dont care condition comes up. These cases are insignificant to us and thus should be neglected . In order to do so we use the Validity. The global clock is also running all the time. There might be instances in our code when we do not need a particular case to run but still does as the clock triggers it. In order to execute a clock physically voltage or current sources are used. These sources use some power during that clock cycle. In complex circuits if such cases are ignored a lot of power will be wasted. So in order to reduce power consumption we remove the clock during such cycles and this process is called as clock gating. The validity helps us with this.

The code for Validity is as follows for the pythagorean calculator:-

```bash
\m5_TLV_version 1d: tl-x.org
\m5
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
	`include "sqrt32.v"
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)

\m5
   // =================================================
   // Welcome!  New to Makerchip? Try the "Learn" menu.
   // =================================================
   
   //use(m5-1.0)   /// uncomment to use M5 macro library.
\SV
	`include "sqrt32.v"
   // Macro providing required top-level module definition, random
   // stimulus support, and Verilator config.
   m5_makerchip_module   // (Expanded in Nav-TLV pane.)

            $aa_sq[31:0] = $aa[3:0] * $aa[3:0];
            $bb_sq[31:0] = $bb[3:0] * $bb[3:0];
         @2
            $cc_sq[31:0] = $aa_sq + $bb_sq;
         @3
            $cc[31:0] = sqrt($cc_sq);
         @4
            $tot_dist[63:0] = $reset ? 0 : $valid ? (>>1$tot_dist + $cc) : >>1$tot_dist;

   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).

         $clk_omkar = *clk;
         $reset = *reset;
         $valid = $reset ? 0 : (>>1$valid + 1);
         $valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;
      ?$valid
         @1
            $val1[31:0] = >>2$result[31:0];
            $val2[31:0] = $rand2[3:0];
         @2
            $out[31:0] = $valid_or_reset ? 32'b0 : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b00) ? ($val1[31:0] + $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b01) ? ($val1[31:0] - $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b10) ? ($val1[31:0] * $val2[31:0]) : ($sel[1:0] == 2'b11) ? ($val2[31:0] != 0 ? ($val1[31:0] / $val2[31:0]) : 32'bx) :  32'b0;
   // Assert these to end simulation (before Makerchip cycle limit).
   *passed = *cyc_cnt > 40;

### Program Counter

The program counter is supposed to increase its value by 4 to fetch the next instruction from the memory. The below image specifies the same. In case a reset is triggered the program counter will be initialised to zero for the next instruction.

The following diagram explains the working of the program counter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72baefa6-30cb-4a22-8caa-b370954765bc)

The following is the code for the working of the program counter

```bash
$pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 0 : ( >>1$pc + 31'h4 );
```
We get the following output after executing the code:-

### Adding the instruction memory

The program counter points to the next address where the instruction is present in the instruction memory. We need to fetch this instruction in order to process it and make further calculations.
