# RISC-V COMPILER OUTPUT and DEBUGGING

Find the output of the C program on the RISC V Compiler using the Spike command and debug the code

## Check the Output and compare with previous output.
In our previous lab, we compiled our C code using both gcc and a RISC-V compiler. In assignment 3 we are going to have find the result of n numbers on the RISCV compiler using the SPIKE command.

### Code for compiling the objdump file
```bash
spike pk sum1ton.o
```
### The compiled code using SPIKE command along with object dump file

* Here we can see that we get the same output in both the process.

## Debug using SPIKE debugger

### Code for debugging the assembly code 
```bash
spike -d pk sum1ton.o
```
We will allow the Spike debugger to run until the main function, specifically until the 100b0 instruction. After that, we will manually continue debugging and inspect the a0 register before and after the execution. We observe that the instruction lui a0, 0x21 updates the a0 register from 0x0000000000000001 to 0x0000000000021000
```bash
until pc 0 100bo
```
Next, we will manually debug the next instruction i.e., addi sp, sp, -16. This instruction decrements the stack pointer (sp) by 16. Before executing this instruction, the sp register held the value 0x0000003ffffffb50, which is then updated to 0x0000003ffffffb40.
```bash
reg 0 sp
```
In the assembly code we can see that the value of the stack pointer is being reduced by 10 in hexadecimal we is equivalent to being reduced by 16 in decimal notation.

## The same thing happens for -O1 as well

```bash
until pc 0 10184
```
